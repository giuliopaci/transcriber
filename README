Binary installation for Unix

   * Make sure you have an installed version of Tcl/Tk 8.0 or higher and get
     the binary archive for your system (e.g. Linux, Solaris...) matching
     your version of Tcl/Tk (8.0 ... 8.3).
   * Switch to the place where you want to install the tool, e.g.:

          $ cd /usr/local

     If you choose to install into a non-standard directory, make sure to
     set the environnement variables of your system (e.g., PATH and
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to the right values.

   * Extract the files from the archive:

          $ gunzip -c Transcriber-1.4-Linux.tar.gz | tar xf -

   * Launch the tool:

          $ trans

     You will be asked to open a transcription or a sound signal to start a
     new transcription.

   * Look in the Help directory for some hints about Transcriber's use or
     view it directly in your HTML browser (start with
     lib/transcriber1.4/doc/Index.html)

Installation from the sources

Transcriber relies on several softwares or libraries that you need to
install first : Tcl/Tk 8.0 - 8.3, Snack 2.0, tcLex 1.2 and optionaly
NIST/Sphere 2.6 . Step 1-4 are for these modules, step 5-6 are for the
content of Transcriber distribution.

  1. If Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or higher is not already installed on your
     system, get it on Scriptic's server :

          http://www.scriptics.com/products/tcltk/choose.html

     or one of its mirrors and unpack them:

          $ gunzip -c tcl8.3.2.tar.gz | tar xf -

     Choose an installation directory (e.g. /usr/local) and follow
     instructions found in tcl8.3.2/README and tk8.3.2/README (configure
     with --enable-shared option). For Tcl 8.3 under Unix, it will be
     something like:

          $ cd tcl8.3.2/unix
          $ ./configure --enable-gcc --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
          $ make
          $ make install

     Do the same for Tk. If you choose to install into a different
     directory, make sure to set the environnement variables of your system
     (e.g., PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to the right values.

  2. This step is needed only if you plan to use Sphere sound file format
     with Snack. Get NIST/Sphere archive:

          ftp://jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov/pub/sphere_2.6a.tar.Z

     Unpack it in a sibling directory of this distribution

          $ zcat sphere_2.6a.tar.Z | tar xf -

     Then install it:

          $ cd nist; sh src/scripts/install.sh

     You will be asked the target platform. For Linux, choose 10 (i.e.
     custom) and change following values (the other ones should be OK):

        o What is/are the Compiler Flags: -O -Wall -fPIC
        o What is/are the Architecture: INTEL

     NB - For recent Linux Distributions (i.e. Redhat 5.x or Debian 2.x) you
     need to comment the following line inside the file
     nist/src/lib/sp/exit.c : extern char *sys_errlist[]; (thanks to Dafydd
     Gibbon for this information) For the courageous ones, a patch is given
     in the Transcriber source distribution in src/patch-sphere for a
     dynamic compilation of Sphere libs under Linux.

  3. Get Snack 2.0 module:

          http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/

     extract it:

          $ gunzip -c snack2.0.1.tar.gz | tar xf -

     Then follow the instructions in README and install Snack, e.g. with:

          $ cd snack2.0.1/unix
          $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
          $ make
          $ make install

     NB:

        o If './configure' fails, you have probably Tcl/Tk installed in a
          non standard directory; give it with --with-tcl and --with-tk
          options.
        o for use with Tcl/Tk version 8.0, add the option --disable-stubs
        o Be sure to get the latest release
        o In order to use Sphere format, configure with --with-nist=...
        o Test Snack demos!
  4. Get tcLex 1.2 module:

          http://www.multimania.com/fbonnet/Tcl/tcLex/

     extract it:

          $ gunzip -c tcLex1.2a1.tar.gz | tar xf -

     Then follow the instructions in README.txt and install tcLex, e.g.
     with:

          $ cd tcLex1.2a1/src
          $ chmod a+x configure install-sh
          $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
          $ make
          $ make install

     NB - You need to have the complete sources of Tcl for building this
     extension, since it relies on specific header files not installed by
     standard Tcl installation.

  5. Extract the source archive of Transcriber, compile and install it:

          $ gunzip -c Transcriber-1.4.tar.gz | tar xf -
          $ cd Transcriber-1.4/src
          $ ./configure --with-snack=... --with-tcl=... --with-tk=... --prefix=...
          $ make
          $ make install

  6. As options to the ./configure command, you have to give the directory
     where Snack archive was extracted (--with-snack=...), the directories
     where Tcl and Tk were installed (--with-tcl=...--with-tk=...), and the
     directory where you will install Transcriber (--prefix=...). For use
     with Tcl/Tk version 8.0, add the option --disable-stubs.

     NB - If you change the directory structure after installation, you have
     to edit 'trans' launcher script and give the right absolute path:
     TRANSPATH=... (the lib path where transcriber1.4 sub-dir is to be
     found)

  7. Test it !

          $ trans

     You will be asked to open a sound signal or a transcription; some are
     found in the 'demo' sub-directory

Distribution structure:

   * Structure of the source distribution :
        o Transcriber-1.4/
             + README
             + COPYING
             + contrib/ . . . external archives
                  + html_library-0.3/
             + src/ . . . sources for new Tcl commands and Tk widgets
             + tcl/ . . . Tcl scripts.
             + convert/ . . . Tcl script modules for format conversion
             + img/ . . . bitmap images
             + doc/ . . . help files
             + etc/ . . . default files
             + demo/ . . . for sound and transcription files
   * Structure of the binary distribution (as a result of a standard
     installation):
        o lib/ =>
             + html_library-0.3/
             + snack2.0/
             + tcLex1.2/
             + transcriber1.4/ =>
                  + libtrans.so
                  + pkgIndex.tcl
                  + tcl/
                  + img/
                  + etc/
                  + doc/
        o bin/trans

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible problems

   * Playback can fail if there is a mismatch between signal format and
     soundcard capabilities (e.g., 16 bits signal on audio cards which only
     support 8kHz 8 bits mu-law).
